## 🚀 Deployment to Netlify

### 1. Prepare for Deployment

```bash
python deploy.py
```

### 2. Commit and Push

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Prepare for Netlify deployment"
git push origin main
```

### 3. Deploy on Netlify

1. Go to [Netlify](https://netlify.com)
2. Click "New site from Git"
3. Connect your repository
4. Set build settings:
   - Build command: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
   - Publish directory: `.`
5. Click "Deploy site"

### 4. Environment Variables

Set these environment variables in Netlify:

- `FLASK_ENV`: `production`
- `SECRET_KEY`: Your secure secret key
- `DATABASE_URL`: Your production database URL

## 🔧 Configuration

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file (not included in repository):

```env
FLASK_APP=app.py
FLASK_ENV=development
SECRET_KEY=your-super-secret-key-change-this-in-production
DATABASE_URL=sqlite:///medpro.db
```

### File Upload Settings

- Maximum file size: 16MB
- Supported formats: PDF, DOC, DOCX, JPG, PNG
- Upload directory: `uploads/`

## 🧪 Testing

### Run Tests

```bash
python -m pytest tests/
```

### Manual Testing

1. Create a new user account
2. Test file upload functionality
3. Book an appointment
4. Test disease prediction
5. Verify user authentication

## 📊 AI Model

The disease prediction system uses a Random Forest Classifier trained on medical symptom data. The model:

- Analyzes up to 5 symptoms
- Provides disease predictions with confidence levels
- Supports 40+ different diseases
- Uses 132 different symptoms for analysis

## 🔒 Security Features

- Password hashing with Werkzeug
- Session management with Flask-Login
- Role-based access control
- Secure file upload validation
- SQL injection prevention with SQLAlchemy
